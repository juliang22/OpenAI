        Post a list of subrequests to make against this endpoint. Subrequests
        will be executed serially, in the order they are specified in the
        "requests" property of the input. Responses to each subrequest will then
        be batched up and returned all together. Subrequests inherit the headers
        from the main request, with the exception of the GW-Checksum header, but
        headers can be specified on the subrequest and will override any headers
        from the main request.
